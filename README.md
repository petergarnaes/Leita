# Leita - The search engine _almost_ as bad as Bing!

This project is re-implementation of classic algorithms and data structures for search and information retrieval.

This project is implemented in Rust, simply build and run it through cargo: `cargo build; cargo run`. You might need to run the web crawler script first, in order to pull the test data that is indexed.

Project can also be run through docker, simply build `docker build -t leita .` and run `docker run -ti --rm --name leita leita`.

## Final remarks

This project is based on the teachings in "Information Retrieval: Implementing and Evaluating Search Engines" ISBN: 0262528878.

Made in collaboration with DBC A/S.
