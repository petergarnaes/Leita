# Web crawler for collecting H. C. Andersens fairytales

Simple script that scrapes a certain website that has all the fairytales.

Requires python 3 as well as the dependencies in `requirements.txt`, which can be downloaded with `pip install -f requirements.txt`.

Note that Selenium needs the gecko driver for interacting with browsers, os you might need to install that also.
